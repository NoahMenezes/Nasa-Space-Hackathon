also implement bookmarks functionality -> user should be able to bookmark an experiment from the search results page and view all the bookmarked experiments in a separate bookmarks page (from the navbar)

in the bookmarks page, user should be able to remove any bookmarked experiment

don't require analyse with ai button -> clicking on experiment from the search results should directly trigger that action.

also theme of the experiments page doesn't match the rest of the app (use neon dark mode instead of the purple)

fix the knowledge graph -> display proper graph, should display the data properly (in a user readable format)

remove the "Powered by Gemini 2.0" from the ai generated analysis section
basically remove mention of gemini from the ui üëç

also update the readme.md, it should better reflect the features and the tech stack used

upload the screenshot of the tables created in the database and ask which tables can be safely deleted.

//old prompts

ok a major chunk of the project is left
<csv file here>
all the experiments, its authors and links are mentioned in this csv file
save this csv file in a data postgreSQL table,

i have already created a database as mentioned in the readme.md, tell me if i have to create another database or a new table in the same database in postgreSQL

so there is a search engine section in the website.

the user will enter either experiment name (complete or incomplete) or the scietists involved (atleast one scientist

the data will be received by the backend, and the experiment/scientist will be  searched in the database.

all the relevant experiments will be displayed as search results in the search page only

the user can click on any of the experiment

and the link corresponding to the experiment will be sent to the gemini via its API.

gemini will then return summary, knowledge graphs, and/or other tools to summarize a set of NASA bioscience publications and enables users to explore the impacts and results of the experiments these publications describe.

and these results will be displayed on the page. also there will be a back button on the top left corner which can take you back to the experiments search results page.

create all the necessary files, make the necessary changes, tell me database changes if any.
