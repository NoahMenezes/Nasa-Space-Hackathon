## üî¥ Problem Statement

### Issue 1: Visual Insights Tab
**Problem**: The "Visual Insights" section was misleading users by promising visual content but only delivering text descriptions of potential visualizations.

**User Feedback**:
- "Where are the actual visuals?"
- "This just has text descriptions..."
- "Why is this called Visual Insights?"
- "I expected to see charts and graphs"

**Technical Issues**:
- Non-functional section taking up navigation space
- Wasting AI processing time on unusable content
- Creating confusion and poor user experience
- Inconsistent with section naming conventions

### Issue 2: Outdated Loading Screen
**Problem**: The loading screen was basic, uninformative, and didn't match the modern aesthetic of the rest of the application.

**User Experience Issues**:
- No progress indication (users didn't know how long to wait)
- Single static spinner (boring and outdated)
- No visual feedback (seemed unresponsive)
- Didn't align with the space-themed UI
- Made wait times feel longer than they were
